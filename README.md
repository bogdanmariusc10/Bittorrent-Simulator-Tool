# Bittorrent Simulator
The BitTorrent Simulator is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file-sharing system built using MPI and C++. It simulates the core aspects of the BitTorrent protocol, where clients can download file segments from one another. The system models file swarming and uses a priority queue to ensure clients download from seeds with fewer active users. With the help of MPI, messages such as client data and download requests are passed between clients. The simulator includes five key data structures for managing files, clients, swarms, messages, and seed priorities. The program ensures efficient file transfers by updating the swarm data and notifying the tracker when downloads are completed. Clients can download missing file segments from peers, making the entire system efficient and decentralized.
